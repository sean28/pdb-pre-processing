# pdb-pre-processing
<div style="text-align: justify"> This web-based platform offers an integrated solution for both preprocessing and validating protein structure files (PDB), tailored for users engaged in molecular simulations, drug discovery, and structural biology. It allows users to upload PDB files or input PDB IDs, then perform essential tasks including structural cleaning (e.g., removing waters/ligands), format standardization, and batch retrieval of validation reports directly from the RCSB database. With a simple graphical interface, the tool streamlines both correction and verification workflows. Accessible via browser without installation, it enhances productivity and ensures simulation-ready input.
